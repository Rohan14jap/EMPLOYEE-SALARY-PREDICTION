# Employee Salary Prediction

This project predicts whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year using the UCI Adult Income dataset. It uses the CatBoostClassifier, which handles categorical features efficiently.

## 📌 Features Used
- Age, Workclass, Education, Occupation, Capital Gain/Loss, Hours-per-week, etc.

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- CatBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 85.8%
- **F1-Score:** 0.85 (weighted average)

## 📁 Files in This Project
- `EmployeeSalaryprediction.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook
- `Employee_Dataset.csv` – Cleaned dataset used for training
- `Employee_Salary_PPT.pptx` – Presentation (optional)
- `README.md` – Project overview

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or download files
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab
3. Run all cells

## 🧠 Future Scope
- Use more advanced feature engineering
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
- Integrate into HR systems for real-time salary analysis
